Code Review

- All tests passing and website functions well (and looks good)
- Code is refactored well. Methods had a single responsibility and were short in length.
- Code is very neat and clean. Easy to read as someone looking at it for the first time.
- Satisfies the user requirements set out in the challenge
- Really liked how the testing was refactored using spec_helper
- Good use of CSS - thank you for explaining how you did it :)
- Database set up clear in README and migrations folder. Good idea to save images in too.
- Overall, really really good - wish mine looked this way!!


Points from code review
- Everything looks perfect! Only note that rubcop is a test, and should be in the test group in the gemfile.
- Maybe try to solve flash mystery... everything looks set up correctly, so not sure why it's not working.
